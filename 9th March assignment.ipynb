Regardless of whether the population has a normal, Poisson, binomial, or any other distribution, the sampling distribution of the mean will be normal.\n",

    "1. The data must follow the randomization condition. It must be sampled randomly\n",
    "2. Samples should be independent of each other. One sample should not influence the other samples\n",
    "3. Sample size should be not more than 10% of the population when sampling is done without replacement\n",
    "4. The sample size should be sufficiently large. Now, how will we figure out how large this size should be? Well, it depends on the population. When the population is skewed or asymmetric, the sample size should be large. If the population is symmetric, then we can draw small samples as well."
