    "Ans:\n",
    "1. Lower MSE implies smaller prediction errors, which is generally desirable. However, MSE alone doesn't provide information about how well the model explains the variation in the data.\n",
    "2. R-squared, on the other hand, measures the proportion of variance explained by the model. A higher R-squared suggests that the model captures a larger portion of the variability in the data.\n",
