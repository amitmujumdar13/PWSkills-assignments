    "Linear regression relies on several key assumptions to produce accurate and reliable results. These assumptions are important to ensure that the model is appropriate for the data and that the estimated coefficients are unbiased and consistent. Below are the main assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables should be linear. This means that changes in the independent variables should result in proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other. There should be no autocorrelation or patterns in the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) over time or among observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The residuals should have constant variance across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of residuals should be similar throughout the range of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This assumption is necessary for valid hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Multicollinearity: There should be no perfect linear relationship among the independent variables. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable coefficient estimates and make it difficult to interpret the individual effects of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Endogeneity: The independent variables should be exogenous, meaning they are not affected by the error term in the regression equation. Endogeneity can lead to biased coefficient estimates.\n",
